volkszaehler.org uses doctrine [1] as database abstraction and object relation model.

To setup your database follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a proper configuration file (etc/volkszaehler.conf.php)
2. Adjust the configuration to your database setup
3. Call misc/tools/doctrine orm:schema-tool:create --dump-sql > misc/sql/mysql.sql
4. Import the resulting file using your favorite sql tool

Alternatively you can directly import a existing mysql.sql file or
force the script to do it for you by leaving the "--dump-sql" option.
